Title is "Life Expectancy Analysis and Prediction"

Abstract: 
Focusing on some potential factors that might affect the life expectancy at birth. A
prediction about the lifespan of people in a particular country will also be performed based on our model.
Statistical methods such as model selection, ANOVA F test, multiple regression, and model diagnostics
are used in this analysis. Based on the results, health expenditure per capita, the percentage of population
with access to improved water source, child immunization against measles, and the continent the country
belongs to clearly have some impacts on the life expectancy at birth.
